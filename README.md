# lua-resty-fileinfo

`lua-resty-fileinfo` is a file information library implementing LuaJIT bindings to `libmagic`.

## Hello World with lua-resty-fileinfo

```lua
local fileinfo = require "resty.fileinfo"
fileinfo"plain-text.txt"
```

This will return string containing `ASCII text`. But there are other information available as well.

## Installation

Just place [`fileinfo.lua`](https://github.com/bungle/lua-resty-fileinfo/blob/master/lib/resty/fileinfo.lua) somewhere in your `package.path`, preferably under `resty` directory. If you are using OpenResty, the default location would be `/usr/local/openresty/lualib/resty`.

### Compiling and Installing libmagic C-library

Consult your operating system or package management about installing this (usually it is already installed in most systems).
